Still being developed and is not a finished product. The main working script is **`industry_screener2.py`** - this is the latest and most complete version.

## Quick Start

- Finds stocks with **who are small market cap and/or above**, **have strong technical setups** (above SMA50/200), have historically made **new highs/gains on a weekly, monthly, quarterly bases** and are **liquid leaders**.
- Calculates **Average Dollar Volume** to identify liquid leaders
- Exports the results into a .csv file
- Uses Finviz data
- Takes 45minutes to an hour to run the complete scan

## Repository Structure

- **`industry_screener2.py`** ‚Üê **Main working script (use this one)**
- `requirements.txt` - Required Python packages
- Other `.py` files - Various development experiments (incomplete)

## Output
